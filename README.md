**Investigating Netflix Movies - Python**

**Project Description**

Explore Netflix movie data and perform exploratory data analysis for a production company to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade.

**Data**

The dataset is netflix_data.csv

**Methodology**

Perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.

● What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).

● A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.

**Steps involved**
1. Import the required libraries
2. Read CSV as dataframe
3. Subset the dataframe for type "Movie"
4. Filter to keep only movies released in 1990
5. Visualize the data to see the distribution of movie duration
6. Filter data for "Action" movies
7. Create iteration to count the short movies
